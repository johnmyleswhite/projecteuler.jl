# Problem Statement

# Solution Strategy
* Even Fibonacci numbers occur once every three numbers
* Why?
* Sum of two odds is even
* Sum of odd and even is odd
* So pattern is
* 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
* ODD, EVEN, ODD, ODD, EVEN

* Another cleaner way to write this is
* 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
* ODD, ODD, EVEN, ODD, ODD, EVEN

* So only Fibonacci numbers with indices of the form `3k + 2` are even
* So list Fibonacci numbers below bound
* Find top index, store in `index_of_bound`
* Indices to even Fibonacci numbers are then simply `[2:3:index_of_bound]`
* Answer is `sum(fibs[indices])`
