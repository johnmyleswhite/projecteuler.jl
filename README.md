# Solutions to Project Euler Problems in Julia

* These are my current solutions to Project Euler problems. They are ugly and may require supervision to extract the correct answer. I'll clean them up over time. My reason for publishing them is to demonstrate some tools in Julia that are underdocumented (e.g. BigInt's) and to make my library of mathematical functions public before I clean them up for separate distribution. For example, there is an implementation of Pollard's rho algorithm for factorizing numbers that may be useful to others.
